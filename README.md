# 🧮 Python GUI Calculator

Welcome to my Python-based GUI calculator project! 🎉 This calculator is built using the powerful `tkinter` library and serves as a simple yet fully functional application for solving arithmetic expressions. It supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even parentheses for more complex calculations. 🤖💻

### 🚀 Features:
- 🧑‍💻 **Simple and clean design** using `tkinter` for intuitive use.
- 🔢 Supports basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and more.
- 🧹 **Clear (C)** and **equals (=)** buttons to evaluate results instantly.
- 🧠 **Error handling**: Shows "Error" if the input is invalid.
- 🔄 Supports continuous calculations without resetting the application.

### 🔧 How It Works:
This calculator handles user input through a text entry and buttons for numbers and operators. It then evaluates the entered mathematical expressions and displays the result. Below is a breakdown of the implementation:

### 📝 Code Explanation:

Let's break down the code, line by line. 📜

1. **Importing Required Libraries**:
   ```python
   from tkinter import Tk, Entry, Button, StringVar
   ```
   - `tkinter`: Python's standard GUI library used for creating window-based applications.
   - `StringVar`: A variable that binds to the entry display for real-time updates.

2. **Defining the Calculator Class**:
   ```python
   class Calculator:
   ```
   - The `Calculator` class contains the main logic of our calculator.

3. **Window Configuration**:
   ```python
   def configure_window(self, master):
       master.title("Calculator")
       master.geometry('357x420+0+0')
       master.config(bg='white')
       master.resizable(False, False)
   ```
   - The window title is set as "Calculator".
   - The window size is defined as 357x420, with a fixed background color and no resizing.

4. **Creating the Display**:
   ```python
   def create_display(self, master):
       Entry(master, width=17, bg='#fff', font=('Arial Bold', 28), textvariable=self.equation).place(x=0, y=0)
   ```
   - A text entry is used to display the current input and results.
   - The font size and color are customized for readability.

5. **Creating the Buttons**:
   ```python
   def create_buttons(self, master):
       buttons = [
           ('(', 0, 70), (')', 90, 70), ('%', 180, 70), ('C', 270, 70),
           ('7', 0, 140), ('8', 90, 140), ('9', 180, 140), ('/', 270, 140),
           ('4', 0, 210), ('5', 90, 210), ('6', 180, 210), ('*', 270, 210),
           ('1', 0, 280), ('2', 90, 280), ('3', 180, 280), ('-', 270, 280),
           ('0', 0, 350), ('.', 90, 350), ('+', 180, 350), ('=', 270, 350)
       ]
       for (text, x, y) in buttons:
           Button(master, text=text, width=11, height=4, relief='flat', bg='white',
                  command=lambda txt=text: self.handle_click(txt)).place(x=x, y=y)
   ```
   - A list of tuples represents each button with its text and coordinates.
   - Each button, when clicked, calls the `handle_click` method, passing the respective button text.

6. **Handling Button Clicks**:
   ```python
   def handle_click(self, value):
       if value == '=':
           self.solve()
       elif value == 'C':
           self.clear()
       else:
           self.update_entry(value)
   ```
   - If "=" is clicked, it triggers the `solve` method to compute the result.
   - If "C" is clicked, it triggers the `clear` method to reset the display.
   - For any other button, the `update_entry` method adds the clicked value to the entry.

7. **Updating the Entry Field**:
   ```python
   def update_entry(self, value):
       self.entry_value += str(value)
       self.equation.set(self.entry_value)
   ```
   - The input (value) is appended to the entry string and updated on the screen.

8. **Clearing the Display**:
   ```python
   def clear(self):
       self.entry_value = ''
       self.equation.set('')
   ```
   - Clears the screen and resets the input value.

9. **Evaluating the Expression**:
   ```python
   def solve(self):
       try:
           result = eval(self.entry_value)
           self.equation.set(result)
           self.entry_value = str(result)
       except Exception:
           self.equation.set("Error")
           self.entry_value = ''
   ```
   - The `eval()` function calculates the result of the expression.
   - If there’s an error (invalid input), it shows "Error" on the display.

10. **Setting Up the Application**:
    ```python
    root = Tk()
    calculator = Calculator(root)
    root.mainloop()
    ```
    - The main application loop is started, which keeps the window open until closed by the user.
